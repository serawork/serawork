### Hi there üëã
My name is Serawork. I hold a PhD in computer science from [ENIB](https://www.enib.fr/en/), France. My thesis work focused on automating the manual quality assessment of coffee beans using artificial intelligence techniques - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and computer vision. I designed a mobile application called InfoBuna and deployed the deep learning model to achieve this goal. After completing my studies, I joined the University of Grenoble as a postdoctoral researcher and have been involved in various projects centered around applying deep learning for automated planning. Currently, I am actively seeking data science/Machine learning roles.
