### Hi there üëã
My name is Serawork. I have a PhD in computer science from [ENIB](https://www.enib.fr/en/), France. My thesis work focused on automatizing the manual quality assessment of coffee beans using artificial intelligent techniques - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and computer vision. I designed a mobile application (named InfoBuna) and deployed the deep learning model. After completing my studies, I joined University of Grenoble as a postdoc researcher and worked on different projects which are centered on applying deep learning for automated planning. I am currently looking for data science roles.
